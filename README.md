# floridajs.com

This is the open sourced version of the floridajs.com website.<BR>
We're Pulling from the api.floridajs.com backend to get the meetup.com/floridajs events and the youtube.com/floridajs videos.

If We're live then we'll erase the "next" event on the front page and put the LIVE video on the main screen.
