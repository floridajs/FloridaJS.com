**People Over Products: A Humans First Approach to AI**
-------------------------------------------------------

The human impact of technology gets overlooked in pursuit of engagement metrics and profit margins. Treating users as products rather than people has led to unintended consequences in our social fabric, from divisiveness on social media to digital addiction. This talk proposes a framework for technologists and organizations to embed ethical considerations and human wellbeing into the development process from the start—not as an afterthought. By adopting a ‘Humans First’ approach, we can create technology that genuinely enhances human flourishing in an age when people aren’t even sure what it means to be human.
